When a task reaches a terminal state (`SUCCESS` / `FAILURE` / `TIMEOUT` / `CANCELLED`), if a `callBackUrl` was specified at submission time, the system will send a POST request to that URL.

## Callback Format

```
POST <callBackUrl>
Content-Type: application/json
```

The callback `data` field is identical in format to the query endpoint response:

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "ok",
  "data": {
    "taskId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "input": {
      "model": "jimeng-4.5",
      "prompt": "一只在星空下奔跑的柴犬",
      "ratio": "16:9",
      "resolution": "2k"
    },
    "result": {
      "type": "image",
      "urls": ["https://cdn.example.com/image1.jpg"]
    },
    "created_at": "2026-02-11T10:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-02-11T10:01:30Z"
  }
}
```

## result Field Structure

**On SUCCESS:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Result type: `image` or `video` |
| `urls` | string[] | List of resource URLs. Images may have multiple entries; videos typically have 1 |

**On FAILURE / TIMEOUT / CANCELLED:**

`result` is `null`.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
  - Webhook timeout is 5 seconds; it is sent asynchronously and does not block the main workflow
  - Failed deliveries are logged only and **will not be retried**
  - `callBackUrl` does not support localhost / 127.0.0.1 or other internal addresses (SSRF protection)
  - The outer `code` is always `0`; use `data.status` to determine success or failure
</Warning>
