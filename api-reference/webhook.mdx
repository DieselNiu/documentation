When a task reaches a terminal state (`SUCCESS` / `FAILURE` / `TIMEOUT` / `CANCELLED`), if a `callBackUrl` was specified at submission time, the system will send a POST request to that URL.

## Callback Format

```
POST <callBackUrl>
Content-Type: application/json
```

The callback `data` field is identical in format to the query endpoint response:

```json SUCCESS
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "ok",
  "data": {
    "taskId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
    "status": "SUCCESS",
    "input": {
      "model": "seedance-2.0-fast",
      "prompt": "a cat walking in the garden",
      "ratio": "16:9",
      "resolution": "1080p",
      "duration": 10
    },
    "result": {
      "type": "video",
      "urls": ["https://media.example.com/videos/2026/02/26/a1b2c3d4.mp4"]
    },
    "failure_reason": null,
    "created_at": "2026-02-26T07:42:43Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-02-26T10:12:55Z"
  }
}
```

```json FAILURE (content moderation)
{
  "code": 0,
  "msg": "ok",
  "data": {
    "taskId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
    "status": "FAILURE",
    "input": {
      "model": "seedance-2.0-fast",
      "prompt": "...",
      "ratio": "16:9",
      "resolution": "1080p",
      "duration": 10
    },
    "result": null,
    "failure_reason": "CONTENT_MODERATION",
    "created_at": "2026-02-26T07:42:43Z",
    "updated_at": "2026-02-26T07:42:55Z"
  }
}
```

## result Field Structure

**On SUCCESS:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Result type: `image` or `video` |
| `urls` | string[] | List of resource URLs. Images may have multiple entries; videos typically have 1 |

**On FAILURE / TIMEOUT / CANCELLED:**

`result` is `null`.

## failure_reason

Always present in the response. `null` when no specific actionable reason applies.

**Values:**

| Value | Meaning | Recommended Action |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| `CONTENT_MODERATION` | Prompt or image rejected by content policy | Notify the user; **do not retry** |
| `INSUFFICIENT_POINTS` | Account has insufficient credits | Prompt user to recharge; **do not retry** |
| `null` | No specific actionable reason (transient error, timeout, etc.) | May retry if appropriate |

## Important Notes

<Warning>
  - Webhook timeout is 5 seconds; it is sent asynchronously and does not block the main workflow
  - Failed deliveries are logged only and **will not be retried**
  - `callBackUrl` does not support localhost / 127.0.0.1 or other internal addresses (SSRF protection)
  - The outer `code` is always `0`; use `data.status` to determine success or failure
</Warning>
